Display at any screen, any time. (When working)

To setup this project:
1. Head over to `config` file.
2. Select the  `settings.py` file in the `static` folder.

4. Now to upload image announcements, upload them to the `static` file.
5. But don't forget to add its names at `settings.py`
### Simple!
